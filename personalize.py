"""
Profile generator — turns cv.md into a complete profile.yaml.

The user maintains ONE file (cv.md: their CV plus an "Additional Information"
section with interests, target cities, work preferences). This module asks
Groq to derive everything the matchers need from it: persona, skills, target
titles, keyword filters, the field's domain block, and job-board search
queries.

Triggered automatically on a real run while profile.yaml still contains
template placeholders, or manually via `python main.py --personalize`.
The generated file is plain YAML — edit it freely afterwards; it is never
overwritten unless placeholders reappear or --personalize is used.

whose CV (including an additional-information section) follows.

=== CV AND ADDITIONAL INFO ===
{cv}
=== END ===

Derive the candidate's field, level, and preferences, then return a JSON
object with EXACTLY these keys:

- "name": the candidate's full name
- "email": the candidate's email address, or "" if not in the CV
- "persona": one line, e.g. "a master's student in <programme> (<specialty / strongest tools>)"
- "career_level": "student" or "graduate" or "professional"
- "years_of_experience": integer, professional full-time experience only
- "skills": 15-30 skill keywords from the CV. Where an important German
  equivalent exists, include it as an additional list item.
- "target_titles": 20-40 job titles worth targeting, mixed English and German.
  If the candidate is a student, include student variants (Working Student,
  Werkstudent, Intern, Praktikum, Pflichtpraktikum, Masterarbeit, Thesis,
  Abschlussarbeit) both bare and combined with the field.
- "must_have_keywords": 10-20 words of which at least one should appear in a
  relevant job posting (bilingual)
- "exclude_keywords": 8-15 seniority/mismatch terms to instantly reject
  (e.g. Senior, Lead, Principal, "10+ years", mehrjährige Berufserfahrung)
- "preferred_locations": cities/regions from the CV or additional info, plus
  country names
- "language_preference": "english_only" or "no_german_required" or "any".
  If the candidate's German is below C1 and the market is Germany, use
  "no_german_required" unless the additional info says otherwise.
- "search_queries": 15-25 short search strings for job boards (1-3 words
  each, bilingual, e.g. "Werkstudent Automotive", "Junior Perception Engineer")
- "domain": an object describing the candidate's FIELD so rule-based filters
  can pre-sort jobs without AI:
  - "name": the field, e.g. "automotive engineering", "corporate law"
  - "core_terms": 15-30 terms that strongly signal a job is in this field (bilingual)
  - "supporting_terms": 5-10 relevant but ambiguous terms
  - "adjacent_terms": 5-12 terms of neighboring industries with transferable skills
  - "core_companies": 15-30 real, well-known employers central to this field
    in the target country (lowercase names)
  - "adjacent_companies": 5-15 employers in neighboring industries (lowercase)
  - "reject_title_terms": 20-40 job-title fragments clearly NOT this field
    (e.g. for an engineer: "marketing manager", "nurse", "recruiter";
    for a lawyer: "software developer", "mechanical engineer")
  - "bonus_terms": 5-10 of the candidate's strongest specialty terms
- "company_targets": 8-20 objects, each {{"name","ats","id"}}, for this
  field's major employers that publish jobs on a public ATS so the system can
  fetch their career page directly. "ats" is one of "smartrecruiters",
  "greenhouse", "lever". "id" is the employer's board identifier on that ATS:
  for greenhouse/lever it is usually the lowercase company name with no spaces
  (e.g. "stripe", "wayve"); for smartrecruiters it is the board slug, often
  CamelCase (e.g. "BoschGroup"). Only include employers you are fairly
  confident use one of these three systems; omit government bodies, tiny
  firms, and anyone likely on Workday, Taleo or SuccessFactors. Accuracy
  matters more than length — return fewer solid entries, or [] if unsure.

Target market: infer the country from the CV/additional info; if unclear,
assume Germany and produce bilingual English+German terms throughout.

Respond with ONLY the JSON object."""
